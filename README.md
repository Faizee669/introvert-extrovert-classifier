# Personality Introvert-Extrovert Classifier

A machine learning project to classify personality types as **Introvert** or **Extrovert** based on behavioral survey data. This repository contains an end-to-end solution including data preprocessing (missing value imputation, categorical encoding), model training using Logistic Regression and XGBoost, performance evaluation with classification reports and confusion matrix, as well as feature importance analysis. The final model achieves a robust validation accuracy of approximately 97%.

---

## Project Overview

The dataset consists of behavioral features such as time spent alone, fear of public speaking, social event attendance, going outside frequency, social energy drain, size of friend circle, and social media post frequency. The target variable is the personality type labeled as Introvert or Extrovert.

The project focuses on:

- Handling missing data with appropriate imputation strategies.
- Encoding categorical variables correctly for reproducible transformations.
- Training and validating models with stratified splits.
- Evaluating results with detailed classification reports and confusion matrices.
- Analyzing features to understand the important contributors to personality classification.
- Making predictions on a test set and exporting results for competition or deployment.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Mode imputation for categorical features.
  - Median imputation for numerical features.
  - Encoding 'Yes'/'No' categorical columns as binary.
  - One-hot encoding for multi-class categorical features.

- **Modeling**
  - Logistic Regression baseline with ~96.5% accuracy.
  - XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
  
- **Evaluation**
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on validation data.
  - Confusion matrix visualization.
  
- **Feature Importance**
  - XGBoost feature importance plots to interpret model decisions.
  
- **Prediction & Submission**
  - Predictions on test data and saving results as `submission_xgboost.csv` compatible with Kaggle format.

## Usage Instructions

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Personality-Introvert-Extrovert-Classifier.git
    cd Personality-Introvert-Extrovert-Classifier
    ```

2. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

- Open the notebook `classification-of-introverts.ipynb` in Jupyter or JupyterLab.
- Follow the notebook cells sequentially to:
  - Load the training and test datasets.
  - Perform missing data imputation and encoding.
  - Train models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost).
  - Evaluate models with classification reports and confusion matrix.
  - Generate predictions on test data.
  - Visualize feature importances.

## Results Summary

- Logistic Regression model achieves approx. **96.5% accuracy** on validation.
- XGBoost model improves validation performance with precision and recall above 92% for both classes.
- Confusion matrix indicates strong classification balance between Introverts and Extroverts.
- Feature importance highlights key behavioral attributes influencing the classification.
